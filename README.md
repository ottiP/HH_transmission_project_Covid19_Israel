We quantified the effectiveness of vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine) 
against household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Israel. We fit a chain binomial model of transmission 
to estimate vaccine effectiveness against susceptibility to infection and infectiousness given infection in household settings. 

The R folder contains the code to simulate the household data. To perform the analysis, run the HH_transmission_model_project.Rmd file.
